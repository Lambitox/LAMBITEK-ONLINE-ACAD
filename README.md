# Lambitek Online Academy Deployment & Operation Guide

This guide shows how to deploy, operate, and maintain your online academy project using GitHub and Vercel.

## 1. Project Setup

- Your code should be in this repository: [Lambitox/LAMBITEK-ONLINE-ACAD](https://github.com/Lambitox/LAMBITEK-ONLINE-ACAD)
- Make sure you have a working build script (`npm run build`, `yarn build`, etc.)
- Your project should have a `package.json` (for Node.js/React/Next.js) or equivalent config

## 2. Connect GitHub to Vercel

1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Click **Add New Project**
3. Select your GitHub repo (`LAMBITEK-ONLINE-ACAD`)
4. Configure build settings if needed
5. Click **Deploy**

## 3. Environment Variables

- On Vercel: Project → Settings → Environment Variables
- Add any secrets (DB connection strings, API keys)
- **Do NOT commit secrets to GitHub!**

## 4. Automatic Deployment

- Every push to the main branch on GitHub triggers Vercel to redeploy
- View deployments and logs in Vercel dashboard

## 5. Custom Domain (Optional)

- In Vercel: Project → Domains, add and verify your custom domain
- SSL/HTTPS is automatic

## 6. Backend/API Setup

- If you have backend APIs:
  - Host on Vercel (serverless functions) or another provider
  - Make sure frontend can reach your API endpoints (CORS, URL config)

## 7. Key Features Checklist

## 8. Troubleshooting
